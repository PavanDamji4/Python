# 3rd code of this Python course
# It is about variables and data types

b = "pavan"    # String value assigned to variable 'b'
c = 2.3        # Float (decimal) value assigned to variable 'c'
d = True       # Boolean value (True/False) assigned to variable 'd'

# type() function is used to get the datatype of a variable
print("datatype of a is :", type(a))
print("datatype of b is :", type(b))
print("datatype of c is :", type(c))
print("datatype of d is :", type(d))
