# This is the first program of this Python course.
# It demonstrates the use of the 'print' function.

print("Hello world, I am Pavan Vishnu Damji")  # Prints a string message

print(5)           # Prints the number 5

print(5 + 4)       # Adds 5 and 4, then prints the result (9)

# print(hello)     # This would cause an error because hello is not defined (it's not in quotes)

print(5 * 2)       # Multiplies 5 by 2, then prints the result (10)

print(6 / 2)       # Divides 6 by 2, then prints the result (3.0)
